# keep-fm

Unofficial tool made to save your scrobbles data from https://last.fm locally, and to give opportunity to work with your data.
**Commercial usage is PROHIBITED** - you can **ONLY** use it for **personal** and **non-public** purpose.
In other words - this web application **can't be hosted on the internet** and you can **ONLY scrap data from YOUR account**.
The user, not the author of the code, is responsible for any illegal use.

## Idea
Last.fm is a great service, that I use since 2006. 
I had 3 different accounts (one created after another) and when I started to use Spotify in around 2014, I was annoyed with all the `- Remastered 2005` and `- Radio Edit` annotations that were ruining my scrobbles data.

I wanted to have some option to get a cumulative stats of all of my accounts, **and** to unify track names in scrobbles, to have real information about my top tracks. 

## Features
- Save your scrobbles data in the database 
- Combine scrobbles from more than one account
- Unify and clear track names (for example - remove `- Remastered` from the name)
- Link scrobbled tracks to Spotify (BETA)
